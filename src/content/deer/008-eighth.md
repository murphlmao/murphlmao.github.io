I decimated a family of raccoons will driving back from an event that my coworker hosted, hitting 5 raccoons just sitting in the road like morons. My bumper popped off, but I was able to pop it back on. I still needed the bumper replaced after this, so my car was out of commission for like 2 weeks after this.
