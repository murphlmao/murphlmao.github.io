What if a recurrence cuts a problem into two
subproblems, and both subproblems were
recursively processed?
• What if a recurrence cuts a problem into three
subproblems and...
– Processes one piece (o(log n))
– Processes two pieces (??)
– Processes three pieces (o(n))
• What if there was additional, non-constant work
after the recursion?
