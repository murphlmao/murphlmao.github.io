Here is 5 minutes of easy fun before we get into the real hell of OOP
programming that is C++!

## What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?

One of the thing that was super confusing when I started programming was
"What does abstract mean in this context?" Well, the definition of *word*
abstract is *"existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical
or concrete existence."* Okay, but what does that mean for code? How do
you have code that doesn't have a 'concrete existence'? This is a great
question, but in order to answer that, let's first understand the definition
of an Abstract Data Type (ADT), then show an example, at which point it
all becomes a LOT clearer.

An Abstract Data Type is a data type defined is basically an outline of
what you want something to do. ADTs effectively serves as a blueprint for
creating **structures** (that word is important for later) of data that
encapsulate both data and the operations that can be performed on that data.
There are varying levels of complexity to this, but with C, it's a *lot* more
fun & very simple to understand.
