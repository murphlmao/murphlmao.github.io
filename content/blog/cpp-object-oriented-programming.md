Because of the extensive nature of this post, there will be a table
of contents for easier navigation. This will fundamentally go from
very basic definitions to more complicated, nuanced, and subjective
areas of OOP in C++.

## Introduction
### What are operators?
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

make a table of operators here:

| Type | Operators                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`          |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`           |
| Logical    | `&&`, `\|\|`, `!`                    |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `<<=`, `>>=` |


### What is a class?

- (ADTs) Classes, Polymorphism, & OOP in C++
  - Templates & Operator Overloading
  - RAII
  - Deep copies & the big three
